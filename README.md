# 100 Days of Frontend

Welcome to my **100 Days of Frontend** challenge! ðŸŽ‰

This repository documents my journey of learning and building projects in frontend development over the course of 100 days. Iâ€™ll explore and apply tools and frameworks such as:

- **React**
- **JavaScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **TypeScript**
- **Next.js**

## Goals

- Strengthen my frontend development skills.
- Build a portfolio of practical projects.
- Master modern tools and best practices.
- Stay consistent and push myself to improve every day.

## Projects

comming soon....

_The table will be updated daily as new projects are completed._

## How It Works

1. Each day, I will focus on either learning a new concept or building a project.
2. Iâ€™ll document my progress in this repository.
3. By the end of 100 days, I aim to have a collection of projects and notes showcasing my growth.

## How to Follow Along

- **Watch this repository**: Stay updated with my daily commits.
- **Check out the Projects folder**: Each project will have its own folder with source code and a README explaining the details.

## Acknowledgements

This challenge is inspired by the idea of learning in public and staying consistent to achieve long-term goals. ðŸš€
